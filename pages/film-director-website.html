        <h2 class="project-subtitle ">The Process</h2>
        <p class="project-text">
          The design process for the filmmaker website embraced a participatory design approach, emphasizing a deep understanding of the director's field. This involved two main meetings with the film director to showcase the planned design direction and review progress. One significant learning was the importance of a production file, containing details of films to present upcoming projects and showcase the director's work. 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          My workflow began with creating a comprehensive design system, outlining colors, typography, and specific details. Next, I developed a sitemap to structure the website and determine necessary pages.

        <p class="project-text">
          Content preparation followed, ensuring each page conveyed the desired message or included essential elements. The visual design phase involved multiple iterations to explore various options and achieve the desired cinematic aesthetic, incorporating feedback from the director along the way.
